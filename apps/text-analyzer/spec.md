This is a specification for a Text Analyzer app that uses NLP.js modules to analyze text in order to:

- Analyze sentiment and classify the text as positive, neutral, or negative.
- Detect the language the text is written in (for example, English, French, etc.).
- Extract key phrases from the text.
- Extract named entities such as people, places, dates, and so on.

The app should allow users to type the text they want to analyze or to upload a .txt file.

The app must run in a browser and be hosted in a GitHub pages site.
